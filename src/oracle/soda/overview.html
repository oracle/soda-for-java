  <p>
  SODA is a simple API for working with document collections. The API
  is primarily designed for working with JSON documents, although
  other types of document content, such as images, audio, and video,
  are supported as well.
  <p>
  Find, insert, replace, and remove are some of the operations provided on 
  document collections.
  </p>
  <p>
  The core interfaces are:

  <tr>
    <th>Interface</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleClient</td>
    <td>Entry point for working with the API. For the Oracle RDBMS SODA implementation, the entry point is the oracle.soda.rdbms.OracleRDBMSClient class, which implements this interface</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleDocument</td>
    <td>Document</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleDatabase</td>
    <td>Database of document collections. Provides methods for opening of collections</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleDatabaseAdmin</td>
    <td>Provides DDL and metadata methods, such as collection creation, for the OracleDatabase</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleCollection</td>
    <td>Document collection. Provides find(), insert(), etc. methods</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleCollectionAdmin</td>
    <td>Provides DDL and metadata methods, such as index creation, for the OracleCollection</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleOperationBuilder</td>
    <td>A builder and executor of read and write operations on the document collection</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OracleCursor</td>
    <td>Returned by OracleOperationBuilder.iterator(). Allows iteration over results of a read operation on the document collection. The next() method returns the next OracleDocument from the result</td>
