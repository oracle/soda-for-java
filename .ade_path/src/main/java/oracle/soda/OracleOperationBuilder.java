/**
 * An <code>OracleOperationBuilder</code> builds and executes various read 
 * and write operations on the {@link OracleCollection}, in a chainable
 * manner.
 * <p>
 *
 * An <code>OracleOperationBuilder</code> is first obtained by calling a
 * {@link OracleCollection#find()}.
 * <p>
 *
 * <code>OracleOperationBuilder</code> provides two types of methods: terminal 
 * and non-terminal.
 *
 * <p>
 * Non-terminal methods are used to build up the operation in a chainable
 * manner. They return the same <code>OracleOperationBuilder</code> object, on
 * which other non-terminal or terminal methods can be chained. Non-terminal
 * methods do not cause operation creation or execution. Under the hood, they
 * simply store additional state information in the
 * <code>OracleOperationBuilder</code> object, capturing the specified
 * parts of the operation.
 * <p>
 * Unlike non-terminal methods, terminal methods actually cause
 * operation creation and execution.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *     OracleCollection ocollection = ...;
 *     OracleCursor ocursor = ocollection.find().keys(keys).skip(25).limit(25).getCursor();
 * </pre>
 *  
 * In this example, {@link #keys(Set)}, {@link #skip(long)},
 * and {@link #limit(int)} are non-terminal methods that specify parts
 * of the operation. More concretely, they specify that documents matching
 * provided keys should be returned, the first 25 of these results should be
 * skipped,and the number of results should be limited to 25. The
 * {@link #getCursor()} method is a terminal, so it builds the operation
 * from the specified parts and executes it.

   * <p>
   * Example 1: passing "%mykey%" for {@code pattern}, and {@code null} for {@code escape}

   * <p>
   * Example 3: passing "mykey!_1" for {@code pattern}, and ! for {@code escape}
   * will match a document with key "mykey_1". Since the _ is escaped in the supplied
